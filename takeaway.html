<h1>OUR BEERS</h1>
<h2>Taste and take away</h2>

<p>We stock an ever changing selection of six craft beers. They are beers you have probably never heard of, from micro breweries all around the UK. These brewers only have one mission in life; to brew great tasting beer.</p>

<p>We aim to stock a beer for every taste. From characterful, nutty, dark beers, to light, hoppy beers and a few challenging IPA’s thrown in to boot. Don’t forget, you can buy a three beer taster flight before you decide, or you can take the advice of our beer obsessed staff. We love beer and we want you to love it too.</p>

<p>In the panel on the right is our current range, though they may have switched again before you get here. We pride ourselves in giving you a choice of beer that far exceeds your expectations.</p>

<p>You can order online too and we will drop them off at your door for free*. (order here)</P>

<h2>We Deliver Free</h2>

<p>At the craft beer shop, our mission is to bring great tasting beer to the local community. If you can’t come to us, we will come to you. You can order over the phone, or here on our website. Just register, to prove you are over 18 and away you go. Provided you live in the local community, and order at least 2 growlers, delivery is absolutely free. Click the map to see if you qualify.

<p>If you already have a growler, exchange it with our driver and pay only for the beer. If you don’t have a growler, you will have to pay for one, but then it is yours to refill with beer as many times as you like.</p>

<p>Choose from our great range of beers (here).</p>

<p>If you are having a few mates round, or a dinner party, or a bit of a do, we can deliver beer boxes with a tap, so you can dispense your own beer. They come in 10 pint, 20 pint, and 36 pint boxes and you only pay for the beer inside them. The price on our website is the price you pay, multiplied by the number of pints you order.</p>

<p>Just be aware, our drivers are instructed to deliver to persons over 18 only and you may be asked to prove your age if you look annoyingly young for your years.</p>
